for python 2.7

apt-get install pip

pip install ModuleName # but does not install the module because the path hasn't been showed

now we we know the path of python 2.7 where the modules being stored

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-pakages

now the command will be for installing the module in python 2.7 is

pip install module_name(as example requests) -t "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"

pip install requests -t "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"

problem solved


for python 3.x # x=upper versions in python

apt-get install pip3

pip install ModuleName # but does not install the module because the path hasn't been showed

now we we know the path of python 2.7 where the modules being stored

/usr/lib/python3.7/dist-pakages

now the command will be for installing the module in python 3 or upper is

pip3 install module_name(as example requests) -t "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"

pip3 install requests -t "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages"

problem solved



python

import sys
>>> sys.path.append('/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages') # path has been added to the system thats
 why modules requests is found by the python 2.7
>>> import requests

solved
